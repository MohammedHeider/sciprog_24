In this practical 7 we will using Pointers  to use dynamically allocated arrays.



to compile this code :

gcc -o Pointerusage Excersice.c -lm




to Execute this code:


./ Pointerusage


The Expected output:

depending on the value that programmer insert the estimation value of e will be very similar to the exact value to e. However increasing the polynomial order doesnot lead in all cases to be vey close to the exaxt e value.
