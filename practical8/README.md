In this practical we will concentrate on recursive functions.

for example in this code we write a function that return the Greatest Common Divisor between two positive numbers.
and the code will exit if the user insert -ve numbers.



to Compile this code :

gcc -o Run Excercise8.c



to Execute the code:

./Run


THe expected output :

for example if the input numbers are 70 & 15 so the GCD will be 5.
