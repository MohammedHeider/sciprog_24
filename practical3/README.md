This is Practical 3 for computing the area under the curve

for compiling this code:

gcc-o AreComputing Excercise3.c -lm



for Excuting the code

./AreaComputing


The Output:


The Value of sum before the loop is: 1.732051
The final value of sum is 0.695045
The actual value is 0.693147
abs_difference =0.001898
rel_diff =0.002738
